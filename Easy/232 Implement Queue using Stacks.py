# Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

# Implement the MyQueue class:

# void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
# int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
# int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
# boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
# Notes:

# You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
# Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.
# Follow-up: Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized O(1) time complexity? In other words, performing n operations will take overall O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer.
    
# Constraints:

# 1 <= x <= 9
# At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.
# All the calls to pop and peek are valid.
